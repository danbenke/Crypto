Many people think dolphins and
porpoises are fish, but this is simply not true.
They are mammals, just like dogs, cats, horses,
cows, deer, and humans. Like all mammals,
dolphins and porpoises are warm-blooded,
which means their body temperature always
stays the same. While most other animals are
born from eggs, mammals are born alive. Also,
mammals have lungs and breathe air. Dolphins
and porpoises need to come up to the surface
of the water to breathe through the blowhole
in the top of their heads.
